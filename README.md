This is the web application front-end for Fettler.

Fettler is an automation service for managing <a href="https://fetlife.com/">FetLife</a> user
profiles. It allows you to enable features such as auto-accepting all friend requests. The
service accomplishes this by speaking to the FetLife API on your behalf periodically, roughly
every 15 minutes.
